# Privacy Policy

Launch0 is built with privacy as a core principle.

## Data Collection

**Launch0 does not collect, store, or share any personal data.**

- No analytics
- No crash reporting
- No user tracking
- No advertising SDKs
- No data leaves your device

## Permissions

Launch0 requests only the permissions it needs:

| Permission | Purpose | Required |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Home launcher | To function as your default launcher | Yes |
| Internet | Daily wallpaper download only | Optional |
| Accessibility | Double tap to lock screen only | Optional |
| Usage stats | Show screen time on home screen | Optional |

## Accessibility Service

The accessibility service is used **exclusively** to enable the double-tap-to-lock-screen gesture. It is:

- Disabled by default
- Optional — the app works without it
- Does not collect or transmit any data

## Wallpapers

When daily wallpapers are enabled, Launch0 fetches a wallpaper image from the internet. No personal data is sent with this request.

## Open Source

Launch0 is fully open source. You can review the entire codebase at [github.com/ketansp/Olauncher](https://github.com/ketansp/Olauncher).

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy, [open an issue](https://github.com/ketansp/Olauncher/issues) on GitHub.
