# What is Launch0?

Launch0 is a minimal, open-source Android launcher. It replaces your home screen with a clean, text-based interface — no app icons, no widgets, no distractions.

It is a fork of [Olauncher](https://github.com/tanujnotes/Olauncher) by [tanujnotes](https://github.com/tanujnotes). All credit for the original design and implementation goes to the Olauncher team.

## Why a minimal launcher?

The average person checks their phone 96 times a day. A minimal launcher helps you:

- **Reduce screen time** by removing visual triggers that pull you into apps
- **Stay intentional** about which apps you open
- **Keep your focus** on what matters

## Quick Start

1. Install Launch0 from the Play Store or build from source
2. Set it as your default launcher
3. Swipe up to see all apps
4. Long press anywhere for settings

::: tip
Start typing an app name in the app drawer to auto-launch it.
