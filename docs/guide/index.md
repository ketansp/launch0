# What is Launch0?

Launch0 is a minimal, open-source Android launcher built for productivity. It replaces your home screen with a clean, text-based interface — no icons, no clutter — so you can launch apps faster and stay focused on what matters.

It is a fork of [Olauncher](https://github.com/tanujnotes/Olauncher) by [tanujnotes](https://github.com/tanujnotes). All credit for the original design and implementation goes to the Olauncher team.

## Why minimal + productive?

The average person checks their phone 96 times a day. A minimal home screen removes distractions, and productivity features help you make each interaction count:

- **Minimal home screen** — no icons, no widgets, just the apps you need as text
- **Launch apps faster** with instant search and auto-launch
- **Stay focused** by removing the visual noise that pulls you into apps
- **Track your screen time** to stay aware of your usage
- **Use gesture shortcuts** to access apps and controls in a single swipe

## Quick Start

1. Install Launch0 from the Play Store or build from source
2. Set it as your default launcher
3. Swipe up to see all apps
4. Long press anywhere for settings

::: tip
Start typing an app name in the app drawer to auto-launch it.
