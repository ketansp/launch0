# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I find hidden apps?

Long press anywhere on the home screen to open settings. Tap **Launch0** at the top of the settings page to see your hidden apps.

## How do I set Launch0 as default?

Go to **Settings > Set as default launcher**, or search for "Launcher" or "Home app" in your device settings.

## Navigation gestures don't work

Some devices do not support gesture navigation with third-party launchers. This is a system-level limitation that can only be fixed by your device manufacturer via a software update.

## How do I change the wallpaper?

Launch0 can set a new wallpaper daily. Enable it in **Settings > Appearance > Daily new wallpaper**.

You can also set any wallpaper manually from your phone's settings or Gallery/Photos app.

## Double tap to lock doesn't work

This feature requires the accessibility service to be enabled. Go to **Settings > Gestures > Double tap to lock** and follow the prompts to enable it.

If it still doesn't work after enabling, try toggling the accessibility service off and on again in your device's accessibility settings.

## How do I rename an app?

Open the app drawer (swipe up), then start typing. You'll see a rename option appear.

## Can I uninstall system apps?

No. System apps cannot be uninstalled. Launch0 will show a message if you try to uninstall a system app. You can hide them instead.

## Is this the same as Olauncher?

Launch0 is a fork of [Olauncher](https://github.com/tanujnotes/Olauncher). It shares the same foundation but is developed independently with a focus on minimalism and productivity. If you want extra features like weather, widgets, fonts, and folders, check out [Olauncher Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.prolauncher).
